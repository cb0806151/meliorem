<details><summary>Notes and Such</summary>
<p>  

- How can the app tell that the week was marked as completed or not?
    - I'll restructure the record so thats its organized between completed and inProgress weeks
- How does the app decide which week to look at when it loads?
    - I'll structure it so that it automatically checks which week it is, adds that week (and any missing weeks) to the record, and then shows the current week
- How does the app filter the completed weeks from the incomplete weeks?
    - This will be part of the record restructuring discussed above
